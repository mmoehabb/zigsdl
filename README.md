## About
A relatively easy-to-pick, simple, and straightforward package that developers can use in order to write graphic applications in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/). Just as the name indicates it's build on [SDL3](https://www.libsdl.org/).

- [Run an Example](#run-an-example)
- [Install SDL3](#install-sdl3)

## Run an Example

First ensure to install SDL3 on your machine, and Zig of course. Choose any example file in the examples directory, and then run it with the following command:

  ```bash
  zig build <example>
  ```

For instance:

  ```bash
  zig build moving_box_example
  ```

- **Manual Installation**:

  - Download the SDL3 development libraries from [libsdl.org](https://www.libsdl.org).
  - Extract the archive and add the `include` and `lib` directories to your compiler's include and library paths.
  - Ensure `SDL3.dll` is in your executable's directory or system PATH.

### macOS

- **Using Homebrew**:

  ```bash
  brew install sdl3
  ```

- **Manual Installation**:

  - Download the SDL3 DMG from [libsdl.org](https://www.libsdl.org).
  - Copy `SDL3.framework` to `/Library/Frameworks` or your project directory.
  - Link against the framework in your build configuration.

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

- **Using apt**:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install libsdl3-dev
  ```

- **Manual Installation**:

  - Download the SDL3 source from [libsdl.org](https://www.libsdl.org).

    ```bash
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    ```

### Linux (Fedora)

- **Using dnf**:

  ```bash
  sudo dnf install SDL3-devel
  ```

### Verifying Installation

- Run `pkg-config --libs --cflags sdl3` to check if SDL3 is correctly installed and accessible.
- Ensure your build system (e.g., Zig) can find SDL3 by linking with `-lSDL3`.
